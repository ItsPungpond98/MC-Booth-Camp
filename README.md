# **Minecraft Boot Camp**

This is a potential gameshow where contestants will compete in various challenges to test their Minecraft skills. Starting with 4 excited players, but only one could be the winner.
<br><br>

# Rules
There will be 4 rounds in total, starting with the 3 point-collector rounds, a tie breaker (depending on the state of the game), and the final round.

## Point Collector Rounds
Just like mentioned above, the game will start with 3 point collector rounds which includes the following rounds.

### 1. The Number Of Death
In this round, players will take turn guessing a random number from 0-99. The objective of this round is not to be the one that guessed the pre-chosen **Death Number**. After each guess, the players will get to know wheter their number is more than, less than, or is the death number. If they didn't guess the death number, the rest of the number higher or lower than their guess will be removed.

>**For Example:**<br>
Let the death number be the number **47**. If the Guessable Spectrum is between **18-79**, and a player then guessed the number 59, they will get to know that their guess is higher than the death number *47*. (They wouldn't be able to know the death number at that point) After that, the guessable spectrum will be reduced from **18-79** to **18-58**.

The round ends after someone guessed the death number.

**Scoring Rules:**<br>
| Players | Points Rewarded |
| --------- | ----------|
| Win | 150 Points |
| Lose | 0 Points |

>**Notes:**<br>
>- When no players had guessed the death number, no one would know it, except the host.
>- There will be 3 winning players, 1 one losing one.

### 2. Hit & Miss
In this round, each player will take turns to test their archery skill. First off, they'll have to choose their power-up by randomly picking from a button. Here's the table showing the frequency of the power ups.

| Power Up | Value | Frequency [X/9] |
| -------- | ----- | --------------- |
| 2 Arrows/Turn | Bad | 3/9 |
| 3 Arrows/Turn | Normal | 2/9 |
| 5 Arrows/Turn | Good | 1/9 |
| 7 Arrows/Turn | Very Good | 1/9 |
| Crossbow + 3 Arrows/Turn | Good | 2/9 |

After that, the players will head to the archering range, and test their skills. They will have just a certain amount of arrows (Determinded from the power up) to try and get as close to the bullseye as possible, so the max value possible is 15. As the round goes on, the target will get further while the point increases. Here's another table to visualize the scores.

| Round | Target Distance | Multiplier | Max Points |
| --- | ----------- | --------- | ------- |
| 1 | 10 Blocks | x1 | 15 |
| 2 | 20 Blocks | x2 | 30 |
| 3 | 30 Blocks | x3 | 45 |
| 4 | 40 Blocks | x4 | 60 |
| 5 | 50 Blocks | x5 | 75 |

##### \**The player's score for each round will be counted from their best hit, and the score will be calculated from the total score; the sum of all rounds.*

After all 5 rounds had ended, the scores from each round will be summed up, and the maximum total score purely from performance will be **225 Points**.

<br><br>

If the player got their total score more than the highscore, they will get the bonus 25 points. The starting highscore will be 120 Points. If the highscore is higher than 190 points, it will be reset back to 120 points where the cycle continues again. 

**The highscore will stack over the episodes.*

Therefore the most amount of points you can get from this round is a whopping **250 Points**, making it a point hoarder round.
