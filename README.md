<br><br>

# Rules
There will be 4 rounds in total, starting with the 3 point-collector rounds, a tie breaker (depending on the state of the game), and the final round.

## Point Collector Rounds
Just like mentioned above, the game will start with 3 point collector rounds which includes the following rounds.

### 1. The Number Of Death
In this round, players will take turn guessing a random number from 0-99. The objective of this round is not to be the one that guessed the pre-chosen **Death Number**. After each guess, the players will get to know wheter their number is more than, less than, or is the death number. If they didn't guess the death number, the rest of the number higher or lower than their guess will be removed.

>**For Example:**<br>
Let the death number be the number **47**. If the Guessable Spectrum is between **18-79**, and a player then guessed the number 59, they will get to know that their guess is higher than the death number *47*. (They wouldn't be able to know the death number at that point) After that, the guessable spectrum will be reduced from **18-79** to **18-58**.

The round ends after someone guessed the death number.

**Scoring Rules:**<br>
| Players | Points Rewarded |
| --------- | ----------|
| Win | 150 Points |
| Lose | 0 Points |

>**Notes:**<br>
>- When no players had guessed the death number, no one would know it, except the host.
>- There will be 3 winning players, 1 one losing one.
